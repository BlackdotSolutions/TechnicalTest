# Blackdot Solutions Technical Test

This repository is a fork of the BlackDot Technical Test @ https://github.com/BlackdotSolutions/TechnicalTest.git

It is my answer to the test.

The code was developed from the original Visual Studio Solution in Visual Studio Community for Mac

I hit the google limit despite doing most to the testing on downloaded html files.  I hadnt quite got the UI sorted out with the engine ranks in the correct columns.

Error checking is not as good as it could be but I was unable to try many searches before hitting googles limit.

I have written some tests on a known search term "Joss".  Some of the results were present in both engine results and I then combined these so the user would also have this information.  It uses AJAX to call the controller rather than reloading the page.  I would ususally use a spinner whilst its loading and I would usually put the results in a datatable. It needs more documentation

thanks
Jocelyn
