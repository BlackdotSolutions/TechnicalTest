# Blackdot Solutions Technical Test

This repository is a fork of the BlackDot Technical Test @ https://github.com/BlackdotSolutions/TechnicalTest.git

It is my answer to the test.

The code was developed from the original Visual Studio Solution in Visual Studio Community for Mac










This repository is just a starter to save you a little setup time when completing our technical test.
It's entirely optional if you want to use it or not.

To run the app run "dotnet run -p Bds.TechTest"
To run tests run "dotnet test"


Good luck
